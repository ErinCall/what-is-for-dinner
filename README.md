# What is for Dinner?

One part of making dinner that I struggle with is planning out meals ahead of time. Most of the help I need there is having a list to go shopping for so I can do at least 2-3 days of shopping at a time.

This can consistently reproduce a decision for a given date assuming the tree hasn't changed. Example output:
